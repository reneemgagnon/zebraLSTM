# ZebraLSTM Architecture

ZebraLSTM is designed to optimize LSTM performance by dividing the hidden state into multiple parallel stripes. This document provides a detailed explanation of the architecture and its components.

## Components
- `StripedLSTMCell`: Custom LSTM cell that processes the hidden state in stripes
- `StripedLSTM`: LSTM model that stacks multiple `StripedLSTMCell` layers

## Design Considerations
- Parallelism
- Memory efficiency
- Scalability

## Implementation Details
- Weight and bias initialization
- Forward pass processing
