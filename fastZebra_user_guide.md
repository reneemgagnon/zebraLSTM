Overview

The script fastZebra_basic_example.py demonstrates how to use the ZebraLSTM model with CUDA optimization in PyTorch. It includes:

    Definition of the StripedLSTMCell and StripedLSTM classes.
    Initialization and configuration of the model.
    Implementation of a training loop using mixed precision for efficient computation.

Key Components

    StripedLSTMCell: A custom LSTM cell that processes the hidden state in multiple parallel stripes for better computational efficiency.
    StripedLSTM: A stack of StripedLSTMCell layers with support for dropout and configurable layers and stripes.
    Mixed Precision Training: Utilizes torch.cuda.amp for mixed precision training, which reduces memory usage and increases computational throughput on GPUs.

Usage Instructions

    Install Dependencies:
        Ensure you have PyTorch and CUDA installed.
        Install necessary Python packages:

        bash

    pip install torch

Run the Script:

    Execute the script to train the ZebraLSTM model on dummy data:

    bash

        python fastZebra_basic_example.py

    Understanding the Output:
        The script prints the loss at each epoch, indicating the training progress.
